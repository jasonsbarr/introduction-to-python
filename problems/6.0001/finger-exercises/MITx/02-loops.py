# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 5 minutes

# In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some while loops.

# 1. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

# print 2
# prints 4
# prints 6
# prints 8
# prints 10
# prints Goodbye!

# 2. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

# prints Hello!
# prints 10
# prints 8
# prints 6
# prints 4
# prints 2

# Exercise: while exercise 3

# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 5 minutes

# 3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we
# define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

# 21
# which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

# For problems such as these, do not include input statements or define variables we will provide for you. Our automating testing will
# provide values so write your code in the following box assuming these variables are already defined.

# In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some for loops.

# 1. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

# prints 2
# prints 4
# prints 6
# prints 8

# prints "Goodbye!"

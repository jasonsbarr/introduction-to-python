# Here is the code for a function applyToEach:

# def applyToEach(L, f):
#     for i in range(len(L)):
#         L[i] = f(L[i])

# Assume that
# testList = [1, -4, 8, -9]

# For each of the following questions (which you may assume is evaluated independently of the previous questions, so that testList
# has the value indicated above), provide an expression using applyToEach, so that after evaluation testList has the indicated
# value. You may need to write a simple procedure in each question to help with this process.

# Exercise: odd tuples

# (5/5 points)
# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 5 minutes

# Write a procedure called oddTuples, which takes a tuple as input, and returns a new tuple as output, where every other element
# of the input tuple is copied, starting with the first one. So if test is the tuple ('I', 'am', 'a', 'test', 'tuple'), then
# evaluating oddTuples on this input would return the tuple ('I', 'a', 'tuple').

# Introduction to Computational Thinking and Programming in Python

This course is a general introduction to programming, data processing and analysis, and computational thinking using the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/).

Programming is perhaps the most important tool used in computer science and computing to understand and solve problems relevant to the computer scientist's domain.

Skill with programming is applicable to a wide range of fields, not just computer science. It is my hope that people who work through the materials in this repository will acquire deep and thorough knowledge about how to write programs that help solve the problems relevant to their careers and lives.

This course uses Python v3.6.10, though anything from v3.6 and up should work.

## Course purpose and goals

The purpose of this course is to teach computing and computational thinking from a programmer's point of view, introducing other key concepts from computer science along the way.

This course uses Python to teach programming and computer science, but it is not a course about Python. You will learn how to use many Python language features, but learning Python is secondary to learning how to program.

Furthermore, the goal is not just to "learn how to program," but to learn how to think like a computer scientist in solving problems. Learning how to write actually useful programs is still important, but secondary to the main purpose. If, at the end of this course, you have a whole new understanding of how to think through and solve problems, we will have succeeded in our goal.

## Source materials

It uses materials from the following courses, which are freely available online:

- [MIT 6.0001 &ndash; Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
- [MIT 6.00SC &ndash; Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/)
- [UC Berkeley CS 61A &ndash; Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Spring 2018 version)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/)
- [MIT 6.0002 &ndash; Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/)

I am only using the Python material from CS 61A, not the materials on Scheme and SQL.

*Due to some minor changes in topics in the Berkeley course, I am using materials from both the Spring 2020 and Spring 2018 iterations of the course.*

### Textbooks

The first textbook I'll be following is [*Introduction to Computation and Programming using Python With Application to Understanding Data, 2nd ed.*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition) by John V. Guttag, which is the textbook for the MIT courses ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python-ebook/dp/B01K6F2236)). It covers the material from the OpenCourseWare lectures in greater depth, though you can still get a lot from the video lectures if you can't afford it (or don't want to buy it).

I'll also be using the Berkeley course textbook, which is available freely online:

- [*Composing Programs*](http://composingprograms.com/), by John DeNero (CS 61A)

You *definitely* want to make sure to do the readings from it, as it covers material and examples not found in the CS 61A lectures.

I'm also using these for supplementary readings and extra study, some of which are freely available online:

### Practice problems

There is an extensive collection of practice problems on the CS 61A website, plus assignments, projects, labs, and more. The problem sets for 6.0001 are also available on the OpenCourseWare site.

I'll be using additional practice problems from [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), especially from [30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) and [Chingu Challenge #3 - Python Interview Prep](https://www.hackerrank.com/chingu-challenge-3/). They also have a [full list of Python practice problems](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python).

Note that for 30 Days of Code the tutorial sections are in Java, not Python. They should still be helpful for understanding the logic behind the problems themselves.

You can also find a ton of additional practice problems at

- [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3)
- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=python)
- [Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/python)
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?page=1)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
- [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)
- and dozens of other sites.

If you run out of things to practice, it's definitely because you haven't looked hard enough; all the practice problems you could ever want are just a DuckDuckGo search away.

### Additional resources

You should freely make use of the extensive collection of resources on the CS 61A website, as well as the slides and code on MIT OpenCourseWare for 6.0001. I'm using the CS 61A [Spring 2020 Resources page](https://cs61a.org/resources.html), both because the 2018 one has several dead links and there are more and better resources available on the 2020 page.

[*Think Python, 2nd ed.*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen Downey, which is available freely online, is an excellent introduction to Python and some computer science concepts related to programming, and can fill in for the Guttag book in some places if you don't want to buy it. It's a great resource either way and I highly recommend it&mdash;*especially* if you don't have any experience with programming.

In fact, if you've never programmed before it might be a good idea to work through *Think Python* from cover to cover before you begin with the course material. It has a *much* gentler learning curve, and having the exposure to programming will help keep you from feeling like you're drowning once you get into the meat of the course.

[*Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6, 3rd ed.*](https://pragprog.com/book/gwpy3/practical-programming-third-edition), while not available for free, is an excellent introductory work that includes helpful sections on program and module design. It is inspired by the classic [*How to Design Programs*](https://htdp.org) (which is freely available online).

[*Learn Python 3 the Hard Way*](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) uses a novel teaching method that helps beginners learn the tools they need to begin learning more complex programming topics. Its sequel, [*Learn More Python the Hard Way*](https://learncodethehardway.org/more-python/), focuses on teaching a process for creatively designing and building quality software that helps the reader learn to think like an engineer, and not just someone who can write some code. Both are paid resources, but easily worth the cost.

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) has an excellent [free series to help you learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/) with a bent towards data science applications. It starts with the very basics and eventually gets into some more advanced topics.

## Best practices for assessment and learning

There is no formal assessment for this course.

I recommend working through all practice problems and homework from all 3 courses (except the Scheme and SQL sections of 61A), including any labs, recitations, and practice exams.

Be sure to type *all the code* demonstrated in readings and lectures into an IDE so you can get a handle on how it works and get your brain used to writing code.

Remember, the *most important thing* you can do to ensure better learning and retention of the material is work *systematically* through as many practice problems as possible.

It's **far** more important to do problems than to read more in the books or watch more lecture videos.

Having more information is great, but you should aim for about an 80/20 mix of deliberate practice time to time spent reading/watching.

Follow the advice in the "Studying tips" section of ["Welcome to computer science"](https://sequoia-tree.github.io/welcome-to-computer-science.html) and use the techniques listed in ["How to learn computer science"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17etd_yHLNeUOewTTSSi8MOIKrP0cgL9O_1FYmqQSRME/edit), especially slides 18, 22, and 23. They show how to work through practice problems deliberately and systematically in such a way as to maximize their impact on your learning.

It will also be helpful to give yourself as many opportunities as you can to practice recall of the material with as short a feedback loop as possible from when you first encounter it to when you start quizzing yourself over it.

Give yourself as many quizzes as possible and summarize the course content in your own words, from memory.

It will be frustrating, but it's an amazing tool for learning.

Keep a "Feynman journal" where you write out summaries of all the material studied from memory.

This repo is serving as my own Feynman journal to document my computer science learning path, but I also have a handwritten notebook in which to take notes, practice recall, and summarize in shorter bits.

Remember that simply consuming more material might make it *feel* like you're learning (in a way that makes you feel good about yourself!) but the best way to **actually** learn is to ride that struggle bus through deliberate practice and recall. In fact, the times you feel like you're learning the least because you're struggling so hard will almost certainly be the times you are, in fact, making the most progress.

*It turns out we humans are **really bad** at recognizing when we're learning and when a teacher is using tactics that are effective for helping us learn. The times of our greatest frustration are almost certainly the times when the most learning is happening, and we quite frankly suck at being aware of that.*

Focus on the areas where you need improvement! You gain nothing by continuing to do the things you're already good at. You want to *actually learn*, not just feel like you're learning.

I also recommend downloading a copy of each exam from the relevant course sections and setting aside a period of time to work on as much of it as you can. Try to make it as much like an actual exam as possible to give yourself a good test of how much you've learned. Just because there isn't someone else grading it doesn't mean you can't still challenge yourself!

If doing more than one midterm/final/etc. for the section of the course you're working on seems overwhelming, maybe just take some problems from each course and mash them up into your own exam.

Get creative and have fun with it!

### Exam 1

- Set a 3 hour time block and get as far through one of CS 61A's past Midterm 1 exams and relevant questions from 6.0001 Quiz 1 as you can. Follow the restrictions in the course syllabus.
- Then grade yourself against the solutions using your own grading scale (but be honest about it&mdash;you're only cheating yourself if you fudge the results).
- Repeat if needed until you can get most or all of the answers right.

- Then grade yourself against the solutions using your own grading scale (but be honest about it&mdash;you're only cheating yourself if you fudge the results).
- Repeat if needed until you can get most or all of the answers right.

## Final project

*Not part of either the MIT or Berkeley courses &ndash; I just thought a project would be a good way to provide a capstone experience for the course. After all, the point of programming is to **build things**, not just to do exercises and quizzes/exams.*

Build a major, data-driven application with a web-based REST API and interactive GUI. GUI can be web-based or a desktop/mobile app (bonus points for both). Research and use good architectural practices, database design, and information security practices (including protection against database injection). The GUI should display and allow user interaction with the processed data set and its visualizations.

Application should implement data structures and algorithms learned in this course, including at least one tree or graph structure, relevant machine learning and data science techniques, functional and object-oriented patterns, and file and/or database I/O.
